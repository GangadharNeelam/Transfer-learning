# Transfer-learning

Transfer learning (TL) is a research problem in machine learning (ML) that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem.

For example, knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could apply when trying to recognize trucks.

### Advantages:
 - Consumes less amount of time, as training is not required while using pre-trained models
 - Required less computational power
 - Not huge data is required as models are already trained
 - Highly efficient models, as they are trained on huge data

### Disadvantages:
 - One of the biggest limitations of transfer learning is the problem of negative transfer.
 - Transfer learning only works if the initial and target problems are similar enough for the first round of training to be relevant.
